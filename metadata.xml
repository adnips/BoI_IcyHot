    <description>Some coding practice to figure out how this stuff works and get used to it, as suggested by /u/Kopekemaster (https://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/8ka7ec/trinket_idea_icy_hot/)

Adds a Trinket to the game called the Icy Hot Flame. While held there is a chance of several instances of standard Flames being replaced by Blue Flames.

This includes the following:
standard Fireplaces in every new room entered may spawn as Blue Fireplaces instead,
Flames spawned via Hot Bombs, Ghost Pepper or the Red Candle items may instead spawn as Blue Flames with differing effects

Hot Bomb Blue Flames last slightly longer before fading.
Ghost Pepper and Red Candle Blue Flames have more points of durability than normal.</description>
